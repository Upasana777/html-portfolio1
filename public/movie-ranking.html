<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Super intense and mind boggling</p>
<h3>Hachi : A dog's tale</h3>
<p>Makes me cry everytime</p>
<h3>Mary and Max</h3>
<p>Some of my friends found it super depressing, but the movie is about mental illness and has a great message at the end </p>
